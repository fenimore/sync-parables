## Dining Philosophers

> `N` philosophers eat around a table together, with `N` chopsticks, one between each pair of philosophers. The Philosophers pick up one chopstick, another, eat, and then put the chopsticks down and think. Eventually, each philosopher picks up the chopstick to their left and **deadlocks**, waiting for their right chopstick. Unable to eat, they starve.

##

> A **Barber** cutting hair and a stream of **Customers**. The Barber _thread_ alternates between checking on the waiting room and cutting hair or going to sleep (if there is no one in the waiting room).
